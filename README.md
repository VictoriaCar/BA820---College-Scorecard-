Utilizing Unsupervised ML Techniques on College Scorecard Data to Evaluate Best Value for Money

Project Motivation 

Investing in higher education is a significant decision, yet assessing the true value of a college remains a challenge. The rising costs of tuition and the variability in post-graduate outcomes make it difficult for students and families to make informed choices. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average total cost of attending a postsecondary institution has steadily increased over the years.
This project seeks to address this issue by analyzing college scorecard data using unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as K-means and hierarchical clustering. The goal is to identify patterns among institutions based on key factors, including cost, quality of student life, faculty experience, job placement rates, and post-graduate salaries. By uncovering hidden structures in the data, we aim to categorize colleges into meaningful groups that reflect their overall value for money.
Our goal in this project is to provide data-driven insights to prospective students, policymakers, and educational institutions, enabling more informed decision-making on which undergraduate institutions will provide the best value based on their criteria. Identifying clusters of colleges with similar outcomes can help students find affordable and high-quality education options, bridging the gap between financial investment and career success.
